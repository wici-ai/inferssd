"""Derive one launch's native settings, thread pools and server arguments.

``derive`` is a pure function of the machine characteristics, the model's
header facts, the runtime facts and the platform. It chooses thread counts and
CPU placement, placement cost priors, and the host memory budget and margin; a
launch with a strategy prefills each prompt in one pass.
The pass shape changes the computation, for speed; everything else keeps it
bit-exact. Every prompt pass takes the engine's own route, the SSD sink, and the
VRAM budget's behaviour stays as the engine has it.

Which settings apply on a platform comes from the settings registry's scopes, so
every platform runs this one derivation.

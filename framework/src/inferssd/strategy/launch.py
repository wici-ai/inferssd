"""The strategy step of a typed launch's resolution.

The resolver asks four facts: the machine characteristics, the model's header
facts, the key of the drive holding the model and the runtime facts. A live
launch reads them on this host; a recorded dry-run takes them from its host
facts. The strategy fills only settings and thread pool fields the user left
unset, and its receipt records what it chose, what the user's values replaced
and what it left out to agree with them.

"""Windows process ownership: job objects for groups and scopes, console Ctrl+C for stops.

Windows has no process groups to signal. Each owned server runs in a
kill-on-close job of its own, its group: its descendants stay in that job, and
closing the job's last handle, which only its worker holds, ends them all. A
graceful stop is Ctrl+C on the owned tree's console. The guardian starts in a
new console without a window, which its worker and that worker's server share
and nothing else attaches to; Ctrl+C on that console reaches exactly the owned
tree. The guardian, started in a new process group, ignores Ctrl+C itself.

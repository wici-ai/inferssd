"""The machine characteristics an executed launch derives its strategy from.

Before it resolves, an executed launch makes sure the per-user characteristics
file describes this machine and the drive holding the model. What is missing
or out of date is measured first and saved, so the first launch on a machine
takes a few minutes and later launches reuse the file. A file named with
``--machine`` is used as it is and never measured.

Profiling never stops a launch: a probe that is missing or fails is reported
and its section recorded as failed, and the strategy leaves out what it cannot
ground.
